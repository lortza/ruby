# Given a list lst and a number N, create a new list that contains each number of lst at most N times without reordering. For example if N = 2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].

n = 1
lst = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5]

def delete_nth(order,max_e)
  #your code here
end

delete_nth(lst, n)
